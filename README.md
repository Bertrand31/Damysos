# Damysos

Damysos is an experiment stemming from the idea that tries could be used to store points in a
n-dimensional space in a way that would allow for fast querying of "neighboring" points.

In order to achieve this, we first have to turn each coordinate or every point into a base 4
number such that the more spacial proximity between two points, the more characters their
transformed coordinates share, and this, going from left to right.

For example, if point A's encoded abscissa coordinate is "111", point B's is "112" and point C's is
"100", we can tell that point A is closer to point B than it is of point C and point C is closer to
point A than it is of point B (along the aformentionned abscissa).

This way, in order to get the neighboring points of a GPS coordinate, we only have to compute the
"trie path" for those coordinates, and descend the trie at the desired depth (the level of
precision, or "zoom"). Then, we take all the leaves below that point.

What's interesting in this approach, in my opinion, resides in the fact that nowhere in the code we
are actually commparing GPS coordinates, calculating distances etc. The data structure itself, in
this case a Trie, _is_ the logic.

From early testing, on a _Intel Core i7-7700HQ @ 2.80GHz_ CPU and on a dataset of 128769 points, it
finds all the neighboring points of a given GPS coordinate in under 400Î¼s.

The speed of that search, however, depends on the level of precision (or "zoom") you want to
achieve.  Although it may appear counter intuitive, a lower precision actually means a longer query
time. This is because, if we are using tries 10 levels deeps and we ask for a precision of 5, then
we'll descend 5 levels of the trie and then recursively explore all the branches from that point to
get all the points below it.
Hence, the lower the precision, the less we descend the trie before we start exploring all of its
sub-tries, so the more branches we'll have to explore from that point.

## Usage

First, create a Damysos instance. Then, feed it multiple `PointOfInterst` to add data to it:
```scala
import damysos.Damysos

val damysos = Damysos()
val paris = PointOfInterst("Paris" Coordinates(43.2D, -80.38333D))
val toulouse = PointOfInterst("Toulouse" Coordinates(43.60426D, 1.44367D))
val pointsOfInterest = Seq(paris, toulouse)
val bayonne = PointOfInterst("Bayonne", Coordinates(43.48333D, -1.48333D))
damysos ++ pointsOfInterest + bayonne
```
The `++` method accepts a `TraversableOnce` argument, it means you can feed it either a normal
`Collection` (like the `Seq` above) or a lazy `Iterator`:
```scala
import damysos.PointOfInterst

val data: Iterator[PointOfInterst] = PointOfInterst.loadFromCSV("cities_world.csv")
damysos ++ data // Lines will be pulled one by one from the CSV file to be added to the Damysos
```
From there, we can start querying our data structure:
```scala
damysos contains bayonne

damysos findSurrounding paris
```
Note that `findSurrounding` also takes a `precision` argument to adjust the "zoom" level:
```scala
damysos.findSurrounding(paris, precision=4)
```
It also supports removing single element or a `TraversableOnce` of elements:
```scala
damysos - paris
damysos -- data
```
It also supports returning all of its contents as a `List` and lastly, counting the number of
elements it contains:
```scala
damysos.toList
damysos.size
```

 ## Caveats

Because of the way tries work and of the encoding of coordinates, when we're nearing a "breakoff
point" of the base we have chosen, the trie won't "see" anything that is geographically close, but
which key is right after this breakoff point.

For example, the keys "333" and "400" have nothing in common as far as a Trie is concerned, and yet
they are numerically very close so the points they represent are also very close.

For this reason, this early version of Damysos will sometimes give incomplete results, and will be
"blind" to everything that is after of before the aforementionned "breakup points".
Because of this, it can only be used reliably to return "some close points" as quickly as possible
and cannot be expected to return exhaustive results.

A second version is forthcoming, that will address this issue. But because it will incurr a
performance tradeoff, both approaches will coexist, because the first (current) use-case can be
valid in certain stuations where we do not neeed the results to be comprehensive, we just want
some points, as quickly as possible.
